I am writing to apply for the Graduate Software Engineer position at your FinTech scale-up. As a 2024 graduate with a background in Artificial Intelligence, I am eager to start my career in a dynamic and innovative environment like yours.

I am currently finishing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Surrey, with graduation expected in September 2024. My experience as a Part-Time Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge involved working on data pipelines, data cleaning, and machine learning model deployment using Python and SQL. These experiences have helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and technical expertise.

In my previous role as a Senior Software Engineer at Tiatech Health Technologies, I developed Python microservices for DICOM imaging and teleconferencing. This role required efficient time management and the ability to work well in a team.

I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and contribute to developing new data pipelines and deploying features. The mentorship and training you offer, along with the chance to work in a fast-growing and social environment, make this role a perfect fit for me.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.
