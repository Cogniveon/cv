I am excited to apply for the Graduate and Junior Software Developer position at your company. With a strong background in Computer Science and practical experience in software development, I believe I am well-suited for this role.

At Tiatech Health Technologies, I transformed "TiaImage" into a more user-friendly radiology viewer and developed Python microservices used by over 30 hospitals. Currently, as a part-time Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge, I mainly work on python projects involving digital twin platforms, enhancing my technical and collaborative skills.

My MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Surrey has deepened my expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and NLP. I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team using my new found skills in Python.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background and skills can contribute to your team. I can be reached at +44 7874 368066 or rohit.k.kesavan@gmail.com.
